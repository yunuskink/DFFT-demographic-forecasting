RAW DATA AS OBTAINED FROM NHGIS

Raw population counts for block group geometries from the decennial censuses:
"nhgis0021_csv" subfolder

Longitudinal population changes using NHGIS interpolations to 2010 block group geometries:
filename = "nhgis0010_ts_geog2010_blck_grp.csv"

Raw geospatial data can be found in the "geospatial-apps/data" folder. Due to the large size, these block group shapefiles have been separated by FIPS county IDs and saved using the python pickle format.
